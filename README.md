# imon
imon is short for Image Monitor.

This is a simple GUI application that will continually display the most recent image in a specified directory.

I designed this software to act as a high resolution quick look capability when doing tethered photography.  This program can be left running, particularly in a maximized or fullscreen state, and will continually provide a high resolution look at the most recent photo taken when its watch directory is targeting the folder the camera is saving images to.

This software requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/ "Python.org") and [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/ "PyQt5 - PyPI").

Here are links on [how to install Python3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download "Python Beginner's Guide") and [how to install PyQt5](https://pythonbasics.org/install-pyqt/ "PyQt Install Tutorial") for Window, Mac, & Linux.
